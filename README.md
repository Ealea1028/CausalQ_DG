# CausalQ-DG

Counterfactual Query Effect Distillation for domain-generalized semantic segmentation.

The project studies whether the prediction effect of class-specific semantic queries can remain stable under appearance-only interventions. The first implementation target is a frozen DINOv3 ViT-L/16 backbone with a lightweight segmentation head and a grouped causal-query residual branch.

## Current status

Phases 1 through 3 are complete. GTA5 and Cityscapes passed pairing, train-ID, shape, and readability validation on AutoDL. Phase 4 provides a frozen DINOv3 ViT-B/L dense-feature wrapper and awaits real-weight GPU validation on the RTX 4090D.

## Working directories

- Local development: this repository
- AutoDL project: `/root/autodl-tmp/CausalQ_DG`
- AutoDL datasets: `/root/autodl-tmp/datasets`
- AutoDL pretrained weights: `/root/autodl-tmp/pretrained`
- AutoDL outputs: `/root/autodl-tmp/outputs/CausalQ_DG`

## Local verification

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Local verification is CPU-only. Do not use a local GPU for formal DINOv3-L training.

## Project phases

1. Repository scaffold and contracts
2. AutoDL environment verification
3. Dataset inspection and conversion
4. DINOv3 backbone smoke test
5. Source-only baseline
6. Query-only model
7. Style intervention
8. Prediction-consistency control
9. CQE training
