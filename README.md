# CausalQ-DG

Counterfactual Query Effect Distillation for domain-generalized semantic segmentation.

The project studies whether the prediction effect of class-specific semantic queries can remain stable under appearance-only interventions. The first implementation target is a frozen DINOv3 ViT-L/16 backbone with a lightweight segmentation head and a grouped causal-query residual branch.

## Current status

Phases 1 through 4 are complete. GTA5 and Cityscapes passed data validation, and the frozen DINOv3 ViT-B/L backbones passed real-weight dense-feature checks on the RTX 4090D. Phase 5 implements the source-only DINOv3-L segmentation baseline and awaits its 500-iteration AutoDL smoke run.

## Working directories

- Local development: this repository
- AutoDL project: `/root/autodl-tmp/CausalQ_DG`
- AutoDL datasets: `/root/autodl-tmp/datasets`
- AutoDL pretrained weights: `/root/autodl-tmp/pretrained`
- AutoDL outputs: `/root/autodl-tmp/outputs/CausalQ_DG`

## Local verification

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Local verification is CPU-only. Do not use a local GPU for formal DINOv3-L training.
