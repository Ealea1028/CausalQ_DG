# CausalQ-DG

Counterfactual Query Effect Distillation for domain-generalized semantic segmentation.

The project studies whether the prediction effect of class-specific semantic queries can remain stable under appearance-only interventions. The first implementation target is a frozen DINOv3 ViT-L/16 backbone with a lightweight segmentation head and a grouped causal-query residual branch.

## Current status

Phase 5 is accepted: the repaired 40k DINOv3-L source-only baseline reached 60.17% Cityscapes mIoU with finite training and complete provenance. Phase 6 now adds only the grouped one-way query residual branch and is ready for real-weight GPU checks and a 500-iteration AutoDL smoke run.

## Working directories

- Local development: this repository
- AutoDL project: `/root/autodl-tmp/CausalQ_DG`
- AutoDL datasets: `/root/autodl-tmp/datasets`
- AutoDL pretrained weights: `/root/autodl-tmp/pretrained`

## Local verification

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Local verification is CPU-only. Do not use a local GPU for formal DINOv3-L training.
